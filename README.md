# RandomRespawn
A simple Plugin that makes Players always randomly respawn in the world within a configurable area.

This plugin essentially makes dying a bit more of a punishment while not banning the players outright. Everytime someone dies, they respawn within a square with a configurable range where as the center is 0,0. The number in the config should be above 0 as not to cause any issues.

I have made this plugin because I couldn't find the plugin I used to use where this feature originally came from, so I made it myself as a standalone plugin.

If you have any questions ask in the comments or write me on my discord.
If you like this plugin, give it a good rating (or don't, I don't really care).
